        "\n",
        "My conversation was pretty quick and straight forward. I mostly just used the explanation to the answer to the question on page 40 along with a few examples from the mind your decisions page that I shared. The most effect simple example was the 5 cards from a standard deck example and how two have to share a suit.\n",

        "\n",
        "That said, it did a fantastic job of helping me to know that this was not a question of chance, but of fact. I had been thinking of probabilities and proportions due to my time as a statistician. I needed the reality check that was this portion of the pigeonhole principle to be pointed out to me before it really sunk in.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for the assertion into the philosophical, I appreciate the ideas that were introduced indicating that we don't need to know the answer in order to know that there is an answer. This is a point that I have been coming to terms with for a long time in the religious portions of my life. I don't care much for the connection of the pigeonhole principle to these ideas. I guess I just don't see much philosophy or spiritual weight behind numbers."
