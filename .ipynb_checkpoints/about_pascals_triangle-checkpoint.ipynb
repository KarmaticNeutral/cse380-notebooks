Additionally, Brother Neff told us in class that there was exactly one right answer to this question, and given that we know that one instance exists, the answer \"At most one\" is the same as \"Exactly one\" and therefore \"At most one\" is not the correct answer. After researching for some time, we came to the conclusion that the pattern must repeat itself at some point while the triangle extends infinitely downward and chose \"At least one\" as our answer over \"Exactly one\"."
